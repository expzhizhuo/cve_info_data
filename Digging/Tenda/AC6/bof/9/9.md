## **3、Vulnerability details**

```
In the 'httpd' file, the function 'sub_90998' contains a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. In the function, read 512 bytes of the file and copy it into the s array, and pass the variable to the function without any length checking, which may cause a stack based buffer overflow. Therefore, by requesting a page, attackers can easily execute denial of service attacks or remote code execution using carefully crafted overflow data.
