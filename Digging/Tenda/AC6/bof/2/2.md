```
In the 'httpd' file, the function 'formWifiBasicSet' contains a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. In a function, it reads user provided parameters and passes variables to the function without any length checks, which may lead to stack based buffer overflow. Therefore, by requesting a page, attackers can easily execute denial of service attacks or remote code execution using carefully crafted overflow data.
