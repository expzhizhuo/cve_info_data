## **3、Vulnerability details**

```
In the 'httpd' file, the function 'sub_ADD50' contains a command execution vulnerability. In the "formSetIptv" function, obtaining the "list" and "vlanId" fields, unfiltered passing these two fields as parameters to the "sub_ADD50" function to execute the "doSystemCmd" function creates a vulnerability. Therefore, attackers can use carefully crafted data to cause remote code execution.
