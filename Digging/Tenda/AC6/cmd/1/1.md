## **3、Vulnerability details**

```
In the 'httpd' file, the function 'sub_3A1D0' contains a command execution vulnerability. In the function, assigning the "lan. gst. 1. ip" field to v5 without any filtering on v5 and directly calling the "doSystemCommand" function creates a vulnerability. Therefore, attackers can use carefully crafted data to cause remote code execution.
