#### Describ

​	A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the upnpd service, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code without authentication

#### Detail (Listing with ex6100v1)

​	In the upnp_main function, the data size of 0x1fff is accepted and stored in v81.

​	Next, in the figure below, the function v81 variable is called as the first parameter

​	When processing subscribe and unsubscribe requests, you will enter the gena_http_method_check function a1 with the previous v81 parameter, and follow up this function

​	This function copies the input to the stack through strcpy, and the data is larger than the buffer, resulting in stack overflow. Arbitrary code can be executed without authentication

#### Summary(Listing with ex6100v1)

​	Because the general upnpd service is started by default, it is very harmful and can cause the execution of arbitrary code. This exp can open the latest firmware of EX6100（https://www.netgear.com/support/product/EX6100.aspx#Firmware%20Version%201.0.2.28） Telnetd service for devices
