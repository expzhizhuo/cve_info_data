# Tenda Router AC18 Vulnerability

This vulnerability lies in the `/goform/SetClientState` page which influences the lastest version of Tenda Router AC18. (The latest version is [AC18_V15.03.05.19(6318)](https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2683.html))

## Vulnerability Description

There is a **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in function `formSetClientState`.

In function `formSetClientState` it reads user provided parameter `deviceId` into `v9`, and this variable is passed into function `sprintf` without any length check, which may overflow the stack-based buffer `s`.
