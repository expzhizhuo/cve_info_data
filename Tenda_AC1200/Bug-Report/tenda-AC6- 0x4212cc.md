Type: Buffer Overflow


## Vulnerability description

We found a buffer overflow vulnerability in AC1200 with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to destory the execution memory from a crafted request. This can cause a denial of service or impact code execution.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `httpd` binary:

In function 0x4a12cc, the value of `_src` is obtained through websGerVar.

The `_src` is copied to `info.urls` via strcpy. However, the length of `_src` is not checked, the buffer of `info` is 0x254 bytes. This can lead to buffer overflows.
