Figure shows the latest firmware of V3：V15.11.0.20.

## Vulnerability details

open telnet  <http://192.168.0.1/goform/telnet>
telnet admin/password is root/Fireitup

using ida to analysis httpd, in function formSetWanRoutePolicy:

The program passes the contents obtained by the wanDetectEn parameter to check_enable.
Then, check_enable is set to network.check.enable stored in the system by function SetValue.  
And network.check.enable is passed to old_check_enable by function GetValue, old_check_enable is an array of finite length.
There is no size check, so there is a vulnerability that can cause buffer overflow through wanDetectEn parameter.

## Vulnerability exploitation condition

Need to get cookie after logging in to execute the attack.

The functional data packets are as follows, and we will use this to construct poc.
