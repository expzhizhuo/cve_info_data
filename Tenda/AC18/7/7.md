The function "initIpAddrInfo" contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. In the function, it reads in a user-provided parameter, and the variable is passed to the function without any length check, which may lead to overflow of the stack-based buffer. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution with carefully crafted overflow data.
