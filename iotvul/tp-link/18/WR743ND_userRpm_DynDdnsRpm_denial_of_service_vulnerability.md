## 4 Vulnerability Principle

When the Web management component receives a GET request, its /userRpm/DynDdnsRpm component has a security vulnerability in processing the provider GET key parameter. The provider parameter itself is put into the stack without being checked, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to construct a payload of the provider parameter, so that the carefully constructed parameter causes a denial of service. Attackers can directly achieve the effect of denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.

The firmware simulation process and interface are as follows:

After sending the constructed PoC, denial of service occurred.

## 5. The basis for judging as a 0-day vulnerability

Search for DynDdnsRpm keywords in the NVD database and find no vulnerabilities (the same series of vulnerabilities can be found by directly searching the interface name to find the relevant historical vulnerabilities).

Search for DynDdnsRpm keywords in the CNVD database did not find any vulnerabilities (the same series of vulnerabilities can be found by directly searching the interface name to find the relevant historical vulnerabilities).
