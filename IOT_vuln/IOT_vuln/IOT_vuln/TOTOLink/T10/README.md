### 2. Vulnerability details

![Figure 2 Local of file](images/image-20220212235410138.png)

TOTOLink T10 V5.9c.5061_B20200511 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability in the "Main" function. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the QUERY_STRING parameter.

![Figure 3 Local of the vulnerability](images/image-20220212235159394.png)

We can see that the os will get ` QUERY_STRING`  without filter splice to the string `echo QUERY_STRING:%s >/tmp/download` and execute it. So, If  we can control the `QUERY_STRING`, it can be command injection.

## 3. Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)
2. Attack with the following POC attacks
