The program first passes the contents obtained from the ntpserver parameter to SRC, then sets the SRC value and passes the return value to V1. Finally, the program takes V1 as a parameter through the comitcfm function, which finally causes a command injection vulnerability.

## 3.Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Use the fat simulation firmware V15.03.05.09_multi
2. Attack with the following  overflow POC attacks
