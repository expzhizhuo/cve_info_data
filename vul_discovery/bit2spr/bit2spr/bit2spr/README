This distribution should contain:
	Makefile
	README
	bit2spr.c
	bit2spr.1
	sprite.sty
	test.xbm

Bit2spr converts standard X11 bitmap files to be used by LaTeX in conjunction
with the sprite style file created by Martin Costabel.  Look in it for
details on using sprites in LaTeX.

The file bit2spr.1 is a standard nroff manual page.  Put it in your man
directory, or just view the file with "nroff -man bit2spr.1"

If you have any problems with it, feel free to contact the author of this
program, Marc David Rovner (mrovner@ic.sunysb.edu).  There's nothing strange
in it, so it should compile anywhere, but I've only been able to test it on
HP 300/400 series machines.

Enjoy!
