.SH NAME
bit2spr \- convert xmb type bitmap files into sprites for LaTeX's sprite
style.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bit2spr
[-width widthratio]\ [-height heightratio]                
[-output filename]\ [file] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bit2spr
will read in a bitmaps from the names files or from standard input and
procede to convert them into the sprite files for use in LaTeX documents.
See the
.I sprite.sty
file for information on using sprites.

The sprite information will be written to standard output unless a output
file is named in the options.

Since LaTeX needs to know the dimensions of the sprite, bit2spr takes the
height and width information supplied by the bitmap and uses the default or
given ratios to calculate the height and width of the sprite in inches.  The
default ratios are both 1.5.  Given ratios can be any rational number, but
just because bit2spr allows it doesn't mean the TeX processor will like the
result.

Bit2spr gives the sprites the same name as the filename, which means that
directory slashes will be included.  If no files are named to be read (ie:
input taken from stanard input), bit2spr will only read the first sprite and
name it Dummy.
.SH EXAMPLES
.I bit2spr < test > test.tex
would instruct bit2spr to take standard input (
.B test
in this case) and write
to stadard output (
.B test.tex
in this case).

.I bit2spr -width 2.0 -height 2.5 -output test.tex test
would instruct bit2spr to change the width ratio to 2.0, the height ratio to
2.5, write to the file test.tex, and read from the file test.

.I bit2spr -output test.tex < test
would instruct bitspr to write to test.tex, and read from standard input (
.B test
in this case).
