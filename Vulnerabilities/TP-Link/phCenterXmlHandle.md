# TP-Link Router Vulnerability Report

TP-Link router have a stack overflow issue in `isHttpDataValid` function.

Local users could get remote code execution, this vulnerability currently affects latest WDR, WR, R, WA series, including TL-WDR5620, TL-WDR5650, TL-WR842N, TL-WDR7660, TL-WDR7620, TL-R470P-AC, TL-WDR7661, TL-WDR7650, TL-WDR7651, TL-WA933RE, etc. It affects the linux system and vxworks system. we believe there are much more models suffered from this vuln.

## Vulnerability Description

**Threat model**: An attacker can intercept the traffic between router and Intenet. That is, an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the router.

This vulnerability happen when `isHttpDataValid` handle data from cloud server by using `strncpy`. 

1. Attackers intercept the response from cloud server. 
2. Then attackers send a malicious response to the router. The `Content-Length ` field in this malicious response is filled a long string.
3. `isHttpDataValid` calculate the length of  `Content-Length ` field by using `strstr(v1, "\r\n")`. However, the length is not checked.
4. Finally, whole string of `Content-Length ` field is copyed to the stack by `strncpy` and lead to a stack buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.
