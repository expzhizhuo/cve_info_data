## A3100R_Firmware	 
version:V4.1.2cu.5050_B20200504ï¼ŒV4.1.2cu.5247_B20211129

## Description:
The setMacQos function in the firewall.so module does not filter the "macAddress"  parameter, and a stack overflow occurs when strcpy or strcat  is performed

## Source:

## Analyse:
The program reads a user inputed named "macAddress"   in users's POST request and uses the input immediately,without checking it's length ,which can lead to buffer overflows bugs in the following strcat or strcpy function.

So by Posting proper data to topicurl:"setting/setMacQos",the attacker can easily perform a Deny of service Attack.

there is no webpage calling this function,but we can perform following request to call it.
