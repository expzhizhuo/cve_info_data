# DIR-823G-Update the firmware without authorization verification. #

DIR-823G
Upload firmware without review authority, put the router in a high-risk state or deny service.
## Vulnerable Firmware Versions ##
**DIR-823G REVA1 1.02B05(Lastest)** 

## Analysis ##
Found `<form class="clearboth" style="position:relative" action="/cgi-bin/upload_firmware.cgi" method="post" id="upload_form" enctype="multipart/form-data ">` in **/web_mtn/FirmwareUpdate.html**.

So,uploading firmware update files should be processed by **/cgi-bin/upload_firmware.cgi**.

Try to upload a firmware file and intercept it with Burp Suite.

In upload_firmware.cgi:

    
      __src = (char *)FUN_00400eb4(__filename);
      iVar2 = strncmp(__src,"SUCCESS",7);
      if (iVar2 == 0) {
    printf(
       "window.setTimeout(\"location.href=\'http://%s/FirmwareUpdate.html?UpdateResult=%s\'\",0);"
       ,&local_4f8,"SUCCESS");
	}

In FUN_00400eb4:

    iVar3 = memcmp((void *)((int)__buf + __fd),&DAT_00401640,4);
      if ((iVar3 == 0) ||
     (__fd = memcmp((void *)((int)__buf + __fd),&DAT_00401648,4), __fd == 0)) {
    free(__buf);
    pcVar1 = "SUCCESS";
      }

    //LOAD:00401640 aCs6c:  .ascii "cs6c"
    //LOAD:00401648 aCr6c:  .ascii "cr6c"

It seems that there is no authorization verification, only the first four data that need to be submitted are cs6c/cr6c.

An attacker can update the firmware or make the router stop working without permission.It may even make the router completely unusable.
